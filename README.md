## About
Hi! I'm a Statistics B.S major at **UNC Chapel Hill**. In 2024, I was awarded the UNC SURF— a research grant to supporting my efforts of  analyzing the probabilistic the risks of enteric illnesses among a youth population in Mozambique by building mathematical **prediction models**— this is an extention of the Maputo Sanitation Project, a longitudinal study funded by the **Gates Foundation**, examining the effects of new sanitation infrastructure among a community in Maputo Mozambique. My research interests are to explore connections between existing structures and **community health patterns**.
