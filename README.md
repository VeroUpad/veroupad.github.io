## Profile
Hi I'm Veronica! I hold a **B.S in Statistics** from **UNC Chapel Hill**, with 2+ years of experience in predictive mathematical modeling, optimization, statistical programming, and data analytics for genetic and epidemiological studies. I recently joined **Well Dot, Inc.** as an Operations Intern. In 2024, I was awarded the UNC SURF— a research grant to supporting my efforts of analyzing the probabilistic the risks of enteric illnesses among a youth population in Mozambique. This is an extention of the Maputo Sanitation Project, a longitudinal study funded by the **Gates Foundation**, examining the effects of new sanitation infrastructure among a community in Maputo Mozambique.
